Dataset
The dataset contains various features influencing house prices. Key features used in this project:

Square footage
Number of bedrooms
Number of bathrooms

Model Training
The data is preprocessed (handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.).
A Linear Regression model is trained using Scikit-learn.
The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

Results
Achieved an R² score of X.XX on the test set (Update with actual result).
The model provides insights into how different factors influence house prices.
